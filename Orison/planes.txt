The game 'universe' starts out with only 1 plane.  As the player population grows, planes are added, and players can travel from one plane to another.  Planes start, for the most part, in the base state of the starting plane.

Travel is accomplished through gates.  There may only be eight gates to adjacent planes on any given plane.  The spell to open a gate, (closing the closest gate in the process) has an xp cost equal to the last level of a non-hero, and costs 1 plane prestige.

Planeswalker council:
  Every plane may have a representative on the planeswalker council.
  These players are like Eve's CSM in that they work with the devs to decide issues about the game.  In addition, they can alter some aspect of the planes independently.
  - They can alter the ballance of the elements on any plane, making fire, or instance, more potent than air. (see magic.txt)
