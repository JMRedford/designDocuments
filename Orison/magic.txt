Magic is based on two overlapping diagrams, the square and the phoenix.

Square:

Earth----------Fire
|   \       /   |
|     \   /     |
|       X       |
|     /   \     |
|   /       \   |
Water----------Air

Phoenix:

Degredation----------------Damage
  ||     \   \        /---/   |
  | |     \    \  /--/   /    |
  | |      \    /\     /      |
  | |       Mind  \   /       |
  |  |    /  |    \  /        |
  |  |  /    |  Time          |
  |  | /      \/     \        |
  |  |/       / \      \      |
  |  /|     /     \     \     |
Protection------\   --- \\    |
      |   /      ---------Augmentation
    Healing-----/

Associations:
  Degredation - Earth
  (Damage is not associated with Fire)
  Protection - Water
  Healing - Water
  Augmentation - Air

Elements can combine with other elements to form new elements:
  Earth + Fire = Lava
  Earth + Water = Deluge
  Earth + Air = Dust
  Fire + Water = Steam
  Fire + Air = Inferno
  Water + Air = Blast
  Earth + Fire + Water = Still
  Earth + Fire + Air = Thirst
  Earth + Water + Air = Cold
  Fire + Water + Air = Ethereal
  Earth + Fire + Water + Air = Aeon

Spellcrafting:
  The player has a number of 'slots' which they can fill determined by the level of their Spellcrafting skill. (see skills.txt)  The player may drag a number of effects into those slots determined by their skills.

    Protection - Damage mitigation (multiplicative) (ele)*
    Healing - Healing
    Augmentation - Speed buff
    Damage - Damage (ele)*
    Degredation - Inflicts a status effect (poison, bleed, etc) randomly. Or may be overlapped with an element to choose the status inflicted.
      TODO: element - status chart
    Mind - Wizard's Eye (when it is the only effect in the spell)

  Some effects may be overlapped given appropriate levels of the Aspect-Combination skill

    Deg-Dam - Mitigation debuff and DoT (ele)*
    Deg-Time - Inflict slow
    Deg-Mind - Int debuff and Mana damage
    Deg-Heal - Remove status
    Deg-Prot - Status ward
    Prot-Mind - Immunity to Int, Wis debuffs and Mana damage
    Prot-Aug - Damage mitigation (subtractive) (ele)*
    Heal-Time - Heal over time
    Heal-Aug - Vitality Buff
    Aug-Mind - Wis and Int Buff
    Aug-Time - Speed Buff
    Aug-Dam - Str Buff
    Dam-Time - Dot (ele)* 
    Dam-Mind - Mana Damage

  The aspects without an effect of their own (Mind and Time) can be placed by themselves in slots to modify range (Mind) or area of effect/duration (Time) of the effect in the slot before.

  Mind may extend the range of effects.

  Time may give AoE to:
    Heal, Dam, Deg-Heal, Heal-Time, Heal-Aug, Aug-Dam, Dam-Time, Deg-Dam, Deg

  Time may give duration to:
    Prot, Prot-Aug, Aug-Mind, Deg-Prot, Aug-Time, Aug

  Overlap Mind and Time in the same slot to give both bonuses to previous effect.

The same elements and aspects are used in enchanting weapons, armor, and buildings. (see crafting.txt)

When a multi-element is used in spellcrafting or enchanting, some of its damage or mitigation becomes the type of its subtypes.  For example, a Lava damage spell might do 50 Lava damage, but also 25 Fire damage and 25 Earth damage, whereas a Fire damage spell of the same cost might do 100 Fire damage.

Double element: 2-1 ratio, i.e. 50%-25%
Triple element: 5-3-2 ratio, i.e. 25%-15%-10%
Aeon: 8-4-3-2 ratio, i.e. 16%-8%-6%-4%
