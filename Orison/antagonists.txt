Philosophy:
  There should be very few areas that are permanent, and none that are simply static collections of NPCs.  Groups of NPCs spawn at a time and place when/where no players are around.  These groups spawn with an objective, and a weighted non-deterministic choice of subtasks that may lead to the objective.  Machine learning is used to adjust the probabilities and allow antagonist collections to improve their effectiveness.
