Overview:
  First person big robot shooter (e.g. Titanfall, Mech Warrior) with resource collection, crafting, PvP and tools for emergent gameplay.  As many as three players may share a big robot.  The UI is modular and gives control over some aspect of the big robot, thus no two players may use the same UI simultaneously.

Setting:
  The earth has been eaten by nano-machines.  A large group of survivors exists in a huge dome which emits a simple signal that shuts down the nano-machines in the immediate area.

  The steady rain of non-functional nano-machines provides an abundance of certain raw materials, while the heat difference between the top of the dome and its heat collectors at the bottom provide abundant energy.

  Many years ago, intrepid explorers found that the machines had organized themselves broadly based on the paterns they had assimilated, including mind patterns.  Most of these mind-patterns are hostile, and none can honestly be called sane by human standards.
