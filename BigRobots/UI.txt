Types of user interfaces.
N.B.  Only one player in a Big Robot can access any of these UIs at a given time, with the exception of the View.

Each UI is a window that can be moved and resized on the view screen.  As the window is sized smaller, the exposed functionality changes to the most useful subset.

View (default interface):
  Description: 360 degree view of area around the BR.
  Controls: None

      - Green - unknown
      - Red - hostile
      - Blue - friendly

  Description: 
    Tiny: three radio buttons to set priority between weapons, shields, and engines
