Robot building:
  - Reactor - has a 'power type'
  - Propulsion
  - Sensors
  - Transmitter
  - Computers
  - Shields
  - Weapons

Power Types:
  - Electric
  - Nuclear
  - Point Heat
  - Photonic
  Each type provides bonuses/drawbacks for component attributes.
  Converters may be used in producing components to change power type.

Crafting Skill Tree includes all systems as branches.  Skill levels in each system determine the maximum number of points one may place in a system.  Off these branches are leaves for each attribute.  Skill levels in these determine how many points one may place in an attribute.

Likewise the fitting skill determines the max number of points of all modules in big robot, while the sub skills determine the maximum point size of each module type.
